## Issue Summary:
**Duration:** August 10, 2023, 13:45 - August 11, 2023, 09:20 (UTC)
**Impact:** Web Application Unavailability, 30% Users Affected

### Timeline:
- August 10, 2023, 13:45: Issue detected through monitoring alert indicating a spike in HTTP 500 errors.
- August 10, 2023, 13:50: The engineering team initiated an investigation, suspecting a potential database connection issue.
- August 10, 2023, 14:15: Misleading assumption that high load on the database was causing the errors.
- August 10, 2023, 15:30: Incident escalated to DevOps and Database teams due to persistent errors.
- August 10, 2023, 16:20: DevOps team identified resource exhaustion on application servers and increased response times.
- August 11, 2023, 03:00: Initial attempts to mitigate the issue by restarting application servers.
- August 11, 2023, 06:30: Continuous monitoring showed no improvement, prompting a deep dive into code and configurations.
- August 11, 2023, 08:15: Developers discovered a race condition in critical code paths.
- August 11, 2023, 09:20: The issue was resolved after deploying a code fix and restarting application servers.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
### Root Cause:
The root cause of the issue was a subtle race condition in the session handling module of the web application. Under specific circumstances of concurrent user requests, sessions were being incorrectly shared among users, leading to unexpected data corruption and server crashes.

### Resolution:
The issue was fixed by identifying and addressing the race condition in the codebase. A thorough code review was conducted to ensure that the session handling was isolated and synchronized appropriately. A fix was implemented, tested, and deployed. All application servers were restarted to apply the fix.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
### Improvements/Fixes:
1. Implement thorough code reviews with a focus on critical sections to catch potential race conditions.
2. Enhance monitoring to proactively detect unusual spikes in errors and response times.
3. Invest in load testing and stress testing to identify performance bottlenecks early.

### Tasks to Address the Issue:
1. Conduct a comprehensive audit of the codebase to identify other potential race conditions.
2. Implement automated unit tests and integration tests to cover session handling scenarios.
3. Establish a cross-functional response team to ensure faster collaboration during critical incidents.
4. Enhance documentation around debugging procedures and investigation paths.

This postmortem outlines a web stack debugging incident that led to a 19-hour outage, affecting 30% of users due to a race condition in the session handling module. While the issue was resolved by fixing the code and restarting servers, future incidents can be prevented through code reviews, better monitoring, load testing, and improved collaboration. The incident has reinforced the importance of proactive measures and cross-team coordination to maintain a reliable web service.
